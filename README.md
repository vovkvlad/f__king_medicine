# F**king Medicine
*App keep track of how many times did you take specific pill.*


This is a quick app I implemented within 2 evenings to keep track of my
f**cking pills prescribed for my eyes.

## Note:
As you can obviously get from passive aggressive naming of the app,
I implemented it not becuase the idea is super new, but just because I
got pissed off by loosing track of number of times I've already took this or that pill.
**Thus, the quality of the code is not the best, and functionality might not be ideal**
**as the main purpose was to implement it as fast as possible**

## Support:
If the same matter pisses you off as well, and you find this software somewhat
helpfull - please, get in touch with me with your ideas, or contribute directly an open PRs
(see [Local development section below](#local-development))

## Roadmap:
I might improve functionality in the future, and might not :man_shrugging:
Anyway, the one thing worth adding is cloud sync, so that you can track
progress across devices, as right now it's only localStorage that is available

## Local development:

Clone current repo to your machine

Install local dependencies with

```bash
yarn
# or
npm i
```

then run development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.

Now you can go, and edit whatever files you want, and open a PR with proposed changes!
